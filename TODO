- finish tests:
  - `drop n`
- clarify semantics e.g. 'unique list'
- reorder any code
- init function for globals

- If you want colored output in two columns with pr? see `goto | cat -e`
  Notes:
  - counts escape sequences as characters
  - lines are very short
  - a truncated line often removes closing escape sequence
  Solutions:
  - manually truncate line and end with closing escape sequence
  - color 1 line (offset whichever)
  - separate printing functions
